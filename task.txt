---------
Just as a reminder, the requirements for the test project are:

Write an application for the input of calories

[D]User must be able to create an account and log in.

[d]When logged in, a user can see a list of his meals and calories 
(user enters calories manually, no auto calculations!), also he should be able to edit and delete.

[d]Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: 
a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records,
a user manager would be able to CRUD users, 
and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.

[d]Each entry has a date, time, text, and num of calories.

[d]Filter by dates from-to, time from-to
 (e.g. how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month, if lunch is between 12 and 15h).

[d]User setting � Expected number of calories per day.

[d]When displayed, it goes green if the total for that day is less than expected number of calories per day, 
otherwise goes red.

[d]Minimal UI/UX design is needed.

[d]All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
 (If a mobile app, disregard this).
[d]REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication 
(If a mobile application and you don�t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).

In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional
tests that use the REST Layer directly.
Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.

Bonus: unit and e2e tests!

You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. 
The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app 
is fully functional and doesn�t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.
